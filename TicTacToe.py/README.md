## Introduction
- **Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, usually X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.**

# How to Play:
- ### Player Symbols: At the start, Player 1 chooses their symbol (X or O). Player 2 automatically gets the other symbol.
- ### Taking Turns: Players take turns to pick a row and a column to place their symbol.
- ### Winning the Game: The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- ### Tie Game: If all the spaces are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a tie.
## Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay:** The game prompts players to make their moves and provides feedback on invalid moves (out-of-range or already filled squares).
- **Automated Win Check:** The game automatically checks for a win after each move.
- **Tie Detection:** The game checks for a tie when the board is full.
- **Game Summary:** After the game ends, a summary is provided with the winner or a tie message.
